### Twitter use
as I had wrote, the only use of twitter is to post what do you think or what is happenning in the daily life. However, some users tend to post about other stuff not related to to either news or real world. They post some news about upcoming video games, music, movies, or even sports. to make their audience aware that they are waiting, or there is something happenning other than real news. some people use it when they need to fame something that the real news papers or channels did not mention and this is one of the main reasons that people use twitter.
