# What is Facebook 
Facebook is a website that you can get sociallized with people like [twitter](https://twitter.com/home), but the function is different. by different, I mean that users can post posts with unlimited letters, and socialize with people that are around you such as neighbours, schoolmates and colleagues

### Facebook uses
Recently, facebook add a feature that people can picture their things and put them on a market inside the website. From what have I experince, this consider the best way if people want to get rid of things that might be useful to other people, and people might consider it good way to buy things because they can see the address and the picture of the seller which is safer then buying online.

Also, one of the best Facebook features when it was cerated is privite messeges. privite messeges as it name, users can messege people alone without letting other users that the conversation happend. it was unique in its time.
